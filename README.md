# Brain Tumors MRI Images - 2,000,000+ MRI studies

The dataset consists of **MRI scans** of human brains with **medical reports** and is designed to *detection, classification, and segmentation* of tumors in cancer patients. The data includes a variety of brain tumors such as *gliomas, benign tumors, malignant tumors, and brain metastasis*, along with clinical information for each patient - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/brain-mri-image-dicom/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brain-tumor)**

The MRI scans provide detailed medical imaging of different tissues and tumor regions, facilitating tasks such as tumor segmentation, tumor identification, and classifying brain tumors. This dataset is particularly valuable for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning in clinical settings, focusing on accurate diagnosis of various cancer types.

## Content
The dataset includes:
- **ST000001**: includes subfolders with 10 studies. Each study includes MRI-scans in **.dcm and .jpg** formats,
- **DICOMDIR**: includes information about the patient's condition and links to access files,
- **Brain_MRI_tumor.pdf**: includes medical report, provided by the radiologist,
- **.csv file**: includes the number of studies by conditions and methods of study

## Medical reports include the following data:
- Type of a study,
- MRI machine (mostly Philips Intera 1.5T),
- Patient's demographic information (age, sex, race),
- Brief anamnesis of the disease (complaints),
- Description of the case,
- Preliminary diagnosis,
- Recommendations on the further actions

## All patients consented to the publication of data, data is unidentified

*Researchers can utilize the dataset for a variety of deep learning tasks including tumor detection, classification, and segmentation, with a focus on improving validation accuracy in real-world clinical diagnosis scenarios. The dataset can also support the development of trained models for automatic detection and tumor typing, which is critical for both clinical diagnosis and treatment approaches.*
